# cstring
Wrapper header to make everyone's life easier

This is probably what C++ strings looked like back in the day.

This header (cstring.h) is designed to be 
something a beginner could use to avoid common
 mistakes and that would be useful in industry - 
cross compiler, libc, and platform arch.

Feedback is welcome!

There are a lot of existing libraries that do similar work:
* websnarf/bstrlib
* (this is a direct predecessor) https://github.com/cloudwu/cstring/blob/master/cstring.h
* https://github.com/paulc/sdsutils
